# Day-1 Taxicab Geometry

I have no idea what Taxicab geometry,Manhattan distance,Non-Euclidean geometry or whatever you call this concept.

But after going through some blog posts I came up with a solution which didn't work because I completely ignored directions.

Then after few days,when my intelligent friend Muslih(https://github.com/muslih-DIY) is free we discussed(I asked) and as always he suggested a solution(guy is a freaking genius).

I tried the same in the evening and it worked.
