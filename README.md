# Day-1 Taxicab Geometry

I have no idea what Taxicab geometry,Manhattan distance,Non-Euclidean geometry or whatever you call this concept.

But after going through some blog posts I came up with a solution which didn't work because I completely ignored directions.

Then after few days,when my intelligent friend Muslih(https://github.com/muslih-DIY) is free we discussed(I asked) and as always he suggested a solution(guy is a freaking genius).

I tried the same in the evening and it worked.

my part-1 solution is readable but it violates DRY and is freaking long so after going through part-1 solution of Muslih refactored the solution

once more refactored part-1 

part-2 also I didn't quite understand what we have to find but after checking with muslih I understood the question i.e we have to move one step at a time and check if it visited or else add to visited.

so to store (x, y) coordinates in set we have to stringify them and we have to define initial values again in part-2
